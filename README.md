# Reminder

This project will start from a simple todo web application. The  purpose is to practice some programming skills. But it'll not stop as a demo project. 

There will be no framework used in the beginning. As the development continue, functionality and tools will be added accordingly. The purpose is to find what problem each tool solves.

I assume the final project may include the following:

- [ ] React
- [ ] backend (NodeJS / PHP)
- [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] Rx.js
- [ ] MongoDB
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Desktop Version (Electron)
- [ ] Mobile Version (React Native / Flutter)
- [ ] Progressive Web App
- [ ] Service worker
- [ ] Functional Programming
- [ ] ...

I know this is too much for a simple todo app. So I'll try to make the project more complex than a demo.
